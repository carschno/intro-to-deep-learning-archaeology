# Computer Applications in Arcaeology Workshops 2023

In April 2023 the Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology (CAA) Conference was held in Amsterdam. In the context of this conference the introduction to deeplearing workshop was held twice. 

- [3rd of April 2023 as pre- conference workshop](https://2023.caaconference.org/conference-information/workshops/)
- [13rd of April 2023 as part of the CAA Computational Archaeology Lab.](https://www.archonline.nl/april-2023/computational-archaeology-lab-delving-into-data/) 

The workshop is based on [this](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/deep-learning-intro/) training material and has been adapted for and archaeological audience. The data that has been used for this workshop has been derived from the excavation activities that were performed between 2003 and 2012 for the construction of Rokin metrostation for the North/South metro line. These activties produced a datasets of more than 135.000 records of more than 700.000 artefacts at can be downloaded [here](https://belowthesurface.amsterdam/en/pagina/publicaties-en-datasets). An interactive (and very fancy) website where a subset of the artefacts can be browsed through can be found [here](https://belowthesurface.amsterdam/en/vondsten)  

*Please note that the main aim of our workshop is to teach the basics of deep learning. We therefore made a couple arbitrary of choices to simplify the data and the analysis.*
